# IntrotoGit
A very basic introduction to Git and Github

## Aims
We will showcase the very basic recording of changes possible in Github. The README.md file gives a summary of what the repository contains. it is written in markdown so you can easily add highlighting and other aspects such as links to webpages like [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) 

You can also make text **bold** or _italic_

Or create lists:
- [ ] Item 1
- [ ] Item 2
